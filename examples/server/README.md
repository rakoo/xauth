An example server built with React.js. To run:

1. Edit your bot username/password in backend/server.js
2. Run a webserver:
  $ python2 -m SimpleHTTPServer
3. Distribute http://localhost:8000 to whoever wants to connect

This example needs to have ports 8000 (for the ui) and 9000 (for the
    backend) open.
